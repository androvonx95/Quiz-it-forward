# 🎉 Quiz-it-forward

🚀✨ A beginner-friendly open source quiz project — contribute questions, improve your JavaScript, and learn the flow of pull requests!

---

## 🧠 What is this?

**Quiz-it-forward** is an interactive, open source quiz/trivia app built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  
The idea is simple: contribute quiz questions via JSON and see them live on a fun interface.

But the real goal?  
To **help beginners practice contributing to open source** through real-world PRs (pull requests), just like in [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions).
